        <p>I’ve been testing Apple’s new $249 <mark>AirPods Pro (second-generation)</mark> for a few weeks. They are available to order now and will hit stores on Friday. Out of all of the things Apple unveiled earlier this month, these excite me the most.Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a number of useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a general statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with your comments).</p>
        <p>When you’re using your AirPods Pro and you’re not in noise cancellation mode, you’re in what Apple calls transparency mode. When you press and hold the stem of your AirPods and you can hear the sound of volume being sealed out, or filtering in, you’re toggling between noise cancellation mode and transparency mode.</p>
